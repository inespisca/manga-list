## Why making a list?
Tired of relying in my own memory or 3 different manga-list making websites because none has all manga/light novels I read ever, this is a front-end only solution to a problem I've been having for years. I may re-create this with backend later on.

## Things to be solved:
- Mobile view (not responsive at all for now, sorry)
- Pictures (those are placeholders)
